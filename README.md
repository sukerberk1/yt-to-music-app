# youtube-music-player
This project is a web app that allows its users to download audio from songs to the server in order to listen to them later. Project tries to mimic a streaming platform that can directly treat youtube video audios as songs (perhaps it could be validated by f.e. length)

Web application:    React + react-router v6 (web application)
Server-API:         django + django rest framework + rest_framework_simplejwt (JSON web token authentication)
